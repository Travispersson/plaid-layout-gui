Plaid layout GUI web application.


OBS! Path in app.py is changed >> docker will not properly run. Run the servers locally using yarn and python :).. 

Until this is fixed, the bottom commands are not functional.

--Development--
To start up the development servers run:

make d-build

You may stop the servers running in the containers as such:

make d-stop

You may also remove the containers as such:

make d-down
